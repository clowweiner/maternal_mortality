## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libaries}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
```
#Reading in Maternal Mortality Data from 
```{r}
maternal_deaths <- read_csv("/Users/cecilialow-weiner/Desktop/Data Incubator Project /2013_maternal_mortality_rate.csv")
```

Calculate Maternal Mortality
```{r}


maternal_mortality_rate <- maternal_deaths %>%
  group_by(boro_name) %>%
  mutate(rate=(Maternal_deaths/Live_Births)*100000) 
```

Create Basic Scatterplot for Boroughs
```{r}
ggplot(data = maternal_mortality_rate) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Live_Births, y = Maternal_deaths, color=boro_name))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
